  <p>CI- continuous integration CD- continuous deployment. CI/CD is a tool that enables code changes more frequently and reliable. CI/CD is an automation that enables the developers to save time not spending too much time on bugs that enter while merging the code.</p>
<p>Github actions enable you to include CI/CD workflows directly in Github repository. I prefered Github actions over other sites because its fully integrated into Github without external site. It has also offers you different templests for different type of projects.</p>
